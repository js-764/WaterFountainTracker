            The Skyulkill River water fountain
            status tracker is a map with markers
            indicating the locations (and statuses)
            of the water fountains on and around the
            trail.
        </p>
        <h3 className="tutorialTitles">The Map:</h3>
        <p>
            To navigate the map, drag your cursor or
            finger across the map in whatever direction
            you're interested in observing. There is a
            zoom in/out button to the top left of the map.
            <br />
            On this map, there are a total of 5 fountain
            markers. Click or tap on a marker to observe
            information about the marker or make any changes
            to the fountain status. It will display
            the information with a pop up. Click or tap
            anywhere other than the marker to make
            whatever marker status pop up you opened
            disappear.
        </p>
