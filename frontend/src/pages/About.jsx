            This project was made to help my community.
            Water access is very important.
            It becomes even more important in hot weather.
            This project aims to help people from all
            different backgrounds: runners, cyclers, and honestly
            anyone really who is looking to stay hydrated at
            any time. This website it community driven.
            I invite you to add any changes you happen
            to notice with the water fountains as it
            would really help others! Thanks for
            checking out my website!

            I intend to add more features in the future.
            One thing that I'd like to add is statistical information for
            each water fountain so we can see how often
            they are or aren't working or how likely they
            are to be working. Of course, this information
            comes from community input, so the accuracy
            of the data should be taken with a grain of salt!
            It's just supposed to be an interesting, 
            casual set of statistics! :)
